# Employee Management System
#Date: Feb-2021
Employee Management System Java Project allows you to manage all employee information in a centralized database where you can check, update, and view employee details. It can be deleted in case an employee leaves the company.
I used Java Swing and Java AWT to create a GUI for a desktop application, and Constructor, Inheritance, and Method Overriding concepts were implemented.
Also the JDBC is used to connect and manage data of employees through java applications.
